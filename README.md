## Classification models
Classification algorithms models These are types of classifications models that I have learned over period of time. These include Datasets as well as python file. I have used numpy, pandas , sklearn and matplotlib libraries. This include following models:
1)Logistic Regression
2)K-Nearest Neighbors
3)Naive bayes
4)Support Vector Machine(SVM) 
5)Decision Tree Classification
6)Random Forest Classification

These models also show data preprocessing techniques such as encoding categorial data , feature scaling etc.
