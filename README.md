<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### What is a churn model?
In simpler words we tell whether a user on Social Networking site after clicking the ad’s displayed on the website,end’s up buying the product or not. This could be really helpful for the company selling the product.
Lets say that its a car company which has paid the social networking site(For simplicity we’ll assume its Facebook from now on)to display ads of its newly launched car.Now since the company relies heavily on the success of its newly launched car it would leave no stone unturned while trying to advertise the car.
Well then whats better than advertising it on the most popular platform right now.But what if we only advertise it to the correct crowd.This could help in boosting sales as we will be showing the ad of the car only to selected crowd.
So this is where you come in…
The Car company has hired you as a Data Scientist to find out the correct crowd, to which you need to advertise the car
and find out the people who are most likely to buy the car based on certain features which describe the type of users who have bought the car
previously by clicking on the ad.

### Built With
This was build using following frameworks, libraries and softwares.
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Churn analysis is useful to any business with many customers, or to businesses with few, high-value customers. Which is to say, nearly every company. Companies in different industries use customer churn analytics for a variety of reasons:

* Financial services: Measure account holder lifecycle, detect users thinking of switching banks
* Consumer packaged goods: Develop a support model that encourages loyalty
* Consumer tech: Measure app churn
* Energy: Measure how much revenue is at risk of being lost to other providers
* Healthcare: Calculate the value of patients lost to other providers
* Insurance: Predict a user’s likelihood to close a policy
* Life sciences: Measure churn for device or equipment buyers
* Manufacturing: Measure churn for direct and downstream buyers
* Media and entertainment: Measure subscriber churn
* Retail and e-commerce: Predict when shoppers pose a high churn risk
* Telecommunications: Detect when customers are shopping other carriers
* Travel: Measure churn among repeat web visitors
